## Influence Maximization
It refers to a class of algorithms that aim to maximize information spread in a graph under some budget constraints.
The aim is to find K most influential (seed) nodes from which diffusion of a specific message should start.
This project takes things a step further by adding a constraint of fairness when trying to still maximize influence.

### Definitions
1. Diffusion: the process of spreading a message in a network
2. Cascade: A collection of (source, target, timestamp) for a specific message (post). It can be thought of as a replay of the network spread of a message
3. Group: graph is divided into groups of people with similar characteristics (age, gender)
4. Maxmin: minimize gap of information spread between groups
   - 70% of old males and 69% of young females influenced with same message
   - Proportions are preserved between groups
5. Equity: any personâ€™s probability of being influenced is (almost) the same, regardless of group, preserving the principle of demographic parity
6. Diffusion Probability P(s, t): Probability that node "t" will be found in cascade started by node "s"
   - So t is influenced by s
7. Fairness is defined as a metric between 0 and 1 for a given characteristic (say gender or region) which is calculated on the basis of influenced ratio values of the graph population which is partitioned by the current characteristic
