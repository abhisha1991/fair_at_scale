## Influence Maximization
It refers to a class of algorithms that aim to maximize information spread in a graph under some budget constraints.
The aim is to find K most influential (seed) nodes from which diffusion of a specific message should start 

### Definitions
1. Diffusion: the process of spreading a message in a network
2. Cascade: A collection of (source, target, timestamp) for a specific message (post). It can be thought of as a replay of the network spread of a message
3. Group: graph is divided into groups of people with similar characteristics (age, gender)
4. Maxmin: minimize gap of information spread between groups
4.1. 70% of old males and 69% of young females influenced with same message
4.2. Proportions are preserved between groups
